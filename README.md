# NMRSpecifyRegions

Given a set of frequency locations (e.g., the frequency locations from a Discrete Fourier transform of the NMR FID data) and a list of metabolites, this package filters the set such that the locations near a resonance component remains. This package relies on data from the GISSMO database for the resonance component location prediction.

See the scripts in the './examples/' folder.

More documentation will be added in the future.
